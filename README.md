Dandelion Diary (Dandelion) consists of four major apps:

- Household
- Capture
- Compare
- Contribute

## Household

Household is the application that ties users and financial data together. In the household application, the initiating
subscriber provides basic household profile information and invites others to sign up and become a member of the
household. Only the initiating household member can invite (or remove) members of the household, but other than that
all household members can maintain information associated with the household.

Upon signing up with Dandelion, the household application automatically creates a basic budget structure for the
household; this enables members to immediately start capturing expenses.

## Capture

The Capture application enables members of the household to:

- Enter a new expense
- Explore (and modify) captured expenses
- Reconcile expenses to financial accounts
- Create and maintain tags to notate special or repeating expenses

### Enter a new expense

This feature is based on the concept of capturing expenses based on time of purchase with a receipt. The receipt itself
may be uploaded as an image for permanent record. Also, since a receipt may contain purchases that may apply to more
than one expense cateory, it includes a split feature.

Also included is the ability to note the cost as shown on the receipt but record different amounts to the actual
expense categories. This enables a person to leave a portion of the amount untracked (e.g. you went out to dinner with
friends, paid, but were reimbursed for a portion of the bill) while ensuring the reconciliation process can detect
and match the expense based on exact dollar amount.

Geo location information, if available, is also provided. (e.g. Walmart in Iowa City, Iowa).

### Explore

This feature enables a household member to filter and search on expenses. It also enables updating expenses--e.g. adding
or removing note tags, editing amounts, adding or removing the reconciliation flag, and exporting expenses.

### Reconcile

This feature enables a household member to upload bank statements such as a credit card statement in CSV format. It
then processes the information provided and matches it against items recorded. Items which are found are marked as
reconciled. Items that are not found are shown on a final page and can be easily added (captured) directly on the same
page or ignored.

### Tags

Tags enable making uniform notes on expenses for searching and filter.

## Compare

The Compare application enables members of the household to:

- Create new budget categories
- Define the budget (i.e. set amounts for budget categories)
- View budget and expenses through numbers
- View budget and expenses graphs and charts

### Create new budget categories

This feature enables a household member to modify the description for "core" expenses and to add their own custom
expense (for more info on "core" expenses see Contribute). Expense can be nested up to two levels.

### Define the budget

This feature enables a household member to define a budget for a given budget category. Budgets are date sensitive.
Meaning, rather than replacing a budget that might have been applicable for last year, a new budget amount can be
entered. This enables an accurate picture of budgets and expenses over time; each expense is tracked and compared to
the correct date-based budget.

### View budget and expenses through numbers

This feature enables a household member to view past and current budget numbers and associated expenses based on
budget categories.

### View budget and expenses through graphs and charts

This feature enables a household member to view graphically view:

- Current and past household budget categories; amount and their relative size to each other
- Current month expenses to budget
- Current year expenses to budget
- Year top and bottom 5 drivers

Current year expense to budget includes an analysis by Dandelion that provides a projection of where your expenses
will land by the end of the year (e.g. your total household budget is $36,000, but based on current expenses,
Dandelion calculates you'll likely spend $38,200). This analysis includes information regarding budget drivers.

## Contribute

The contribute portion of Dandelion is mostly undeveloped. It does include a forum to share information but the
"data" driven portion remains undeveloped due to a lack of subscribers.

The vision for this, however, is to compare expenses being captured by various subscribers for "core" (common) categories
and comparing those against other like households. Households performing better than average (meaning less expenses)
would be contacted (by the application) to share their habits and know-how with other households.

Conversely, households performing worse than average would receive 'helpful hints' or "did you know" snippets that might
help them improve.

Geo location information was also to be analyzed both for the individual household to see trends and the community as
a whole to see trends regarding expenses. This would have been less about expense to budget but rather to assess a
general region as being less expensive for households (or more) in general.

Based on this database, a suggested budget would automaticaly be setup for new members based on their household
profile.

And finally, the vision included promotion of campgrounds or services that people used.
