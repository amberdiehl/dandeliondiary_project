                <p>If a provision of these Terms and Conditions is determined by any court or other competent authority
                    to be unlawful and/or unenforceable, the other provisions will continue in effect.  If any unlawful
                    and/or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part
                    will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect.</p>

                <h3>Entire Agreement</h3>

                    relation to your use of this Site, and supersede all previous agreements in respect of your use

                <h3>ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>

                <p>– IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</p>

                <p>Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND DANDELION DIARY (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
                    DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DANDELION DIARY, INCLUDING
                    WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR
                    RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE
                    AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND
                    DANDELION DIARY HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT
                    YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE DANDELION DIARY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
                    RIGHTS, DANDELION DIARY MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL
                    COURT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE
                    LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND DANDELION DIARY WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY
                    NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local
                    “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s
                    jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may
                    bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor DANDELION DIARY will participate in a class
                    action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE
                    GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM
                    YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST DANDELION DIARY INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION
                    OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private
                    attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s
                    account, if DANDELION DIARY is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will
                    be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the
                    event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one
                    hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either DANDELION DIARY or you can elect to
                    have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services.
                    Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent
                    jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have
                    authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree
                    that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of,
                    related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed
                    within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.

                    <p>Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of
                    third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in
                    this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the
                    termination of your relationship with DANDELION DIARY.
